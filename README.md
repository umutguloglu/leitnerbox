GUI of online Leitner Box

This program is designed to help you systematically improve your vocabulary using the Leitner Box method. There are seven layers in a Leitner Box. When you add a new word, it starts in Group 1. Whenever you correctly guess the definition, the word is moved to the next layer. If you guess incorrectly, the word is moved back to the first layer. Once a word reaches layer 7,it is removed from the main groups and added to the 'Completed Layer' (Layer 8). 


Each day, a different combination of groups will be reviewed. Your current day and the corresponding groups are shown on the left. When you finish reviewing for the day, click 'Increase the Day' and you can then close the main window. To add new words, click on the 'Add a New Word' button, fill in the blanks and then add it. If you need to edit a word, click on the 'Edit/Delete a Word' button, type in the name of the word and click search. Then, you can then edit or delete the word.


Finally, to study according to the groups of the day, select the group you want to study from the checkboxes (1 to 7) and click on 'Start Showing the Words'. When you click on 'Show Answer', the answer will be revealed. You can then indicate whether you guessed correctly or not, and the next word will be shown directly.'
